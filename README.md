# Project 02 - Sound

Revision 3.: edited so the fireworks happen closer to the 3D box. 

Revision 2: Instructions remain the same. I edited my particle system to incorpoerate forces and be more meaningful (no longer single elements, but work together to make a firework exposion). In maintaining the space theme, the firework particles are shaped as stars and colored similar to the stars in the middle of the 3D box. 

Revisions: Instructions remain the same - pause/play by pressing "p." My project is still an interactive 3D piece that has been simplified (now it only plays one song - skeletons and ghosts) and fixed to play on beat. Simplifying to one song was very helpful in detecting a beat (before it was too chatoic trying to get a reaction from all songs with very different beats/sounds). Another thing that was missing with my previous project code was the use of a particle system or feedback (in this case I chose to incorporate a particle system). Now, based on the beat, mini glowing stars (particles) will shoot out from all sides of the box and disappear as their lifespan decreases -- they vary in color, size, and velocity!

My project is an interactive 3D piece that visualizes music through a variety of stars. There are large, layered stars in the center that react to beats by pulsating, as well as smaller “stars” surrounding the center piece that change color and brightness based on average wavelength. The 3D aspect allows users to explore and navigate an outer space-like realm for themselves, while real-time audio analysis helps make it a more immersive experience by synchronizing visuals with a range of some of my favorite space-related songs (hopefully you’ll recognize or enjoy some of them!). The user can change the song by pressing the space bar (Note: some songs start off quietly so you might need to wait a second until things get going!) and pause/play by pressing “p.” Colors are chosen with purpose to create an intergalactic and surreal feeling, while noise-based movement gives a natural, space-like flow to the smaller “stars” making up the larger grid/space.
