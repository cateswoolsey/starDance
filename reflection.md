Revision 3.: edited so the fireworks happen closer to the 3D box. 

Revision 2: Instructions remain the same. I edited my particle system to incorpoerate forces and be more meaningful (no longer single elements, but work together to make a firework exposion). In maintaining the space theme, the firework particles are shaped as stars and colored similar to the stars in the middle of the 3D box. 

Revisions: Instructions remain the same - pause/play by pressing "p." My project is still an interactive 3D piece that has been simplified (now it only plays one song - skeletons and ghosts) and fixed to play on beat. Simplifying to one song was very helpful in detecting a beat (before it was too chatoic trying to get a reaction from all songs with very different beats/sounds). Another thing that was missing with my previous project code was the use of a particle system or feedback (in this case I chose to incorporate a particle system). Now, based on the beat, mini glowing stars (particles) will shoot out from all sides of the box and disappear as their lifespan decreases -- they vary in color, size, and velocity!

- What (if anything) still is not complete?
I think I am satisfied with how my project turned out and think it is complete. If anything is not complete, I would say it is the fact that from some angles, the smaller "stars" creating the box are not always fully visible (at some angles they are difficult to see and that is likely due to how they are created/positioned within the 3D layout). I also wonder if there are more ways to implement feedback into my piece -- perhaps that would make it too chaotic though.  

- If it is not complete, what is left and how are you going to address it?
I think improving visibility of the smaller "stars" from all angles would be the biggest thing to address. I think one way I could target this issue is by re-examining their position and seeing if I can subtly rotate them to each face (hopefully that could help them stay in view regardless of the user's viewing angle). 

- What (if anything) did you struggle with?
Working with the 3D layout was pretty difficult at first. It was challenging to get my stars positioned in the right direction/place (same goes for the walls of smaller "stars"). However, once I got a basic layout down, it was much easier to comprehend the 6 different faces that I was working with (left, right, top, bottom, front, back). I think working with sound was also difficult at first -- to make sure that reactions to beats appeared smooth (rather than glitchy and abrupt). It was also challenging to think about my piece creatively in terms of sound -- what shapes/parts of my piece do I want representing beats, wavelength, etc? Which choices would appear the most satisfying?

- What, if anything, have you gained by completing this project?
After completing this project, I think that I feel much more comfortable working with 3D space (of course there can always be room for growth and improvement). I also feel like I now understand how to creatively transform audio data into exciting and interactive visuals (fft, .getEnergy() etc). I think the rendering of the smaller "stars" in the back really helped me better understand positioning and motion (especially when it comes to noise based movement and 3D environments).
